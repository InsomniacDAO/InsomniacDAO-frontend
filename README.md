### Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
├── App.jsx       // Main app page
├── abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io
├── actions/      // Redux actions 
├── assets/       // Static assets (SVGs)
├── components/   // Reusable individual components
├── constants.js/ // Mainnet Addresses & common ABI
├── contracts/    // TODO: The contracts be here as submodules
├── helpers/      // Helper methods to use in the app
├── hooks/        // Shared reactHooks

└── views/        // Individual Views
```


## 🚀 Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._


### Continuous deployment
TBD

**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch. 


## 👏🏽 Contributing Guidelines 

We keep an updated list of bugs/feature requests in [Github Issues](https://github.com/InsomniacDAO/InsomniacDAO/issues). 


![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/InsomniacDAO/InsomniacDAO?style=flat-square)

Filter by ["good first issue"](https://github.com/InsomniacDAO/InsomniacDAO/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get your feet wet!
Once you submit a PR, our CI will generate a temporary testing URL where you can validate your changes. Tag any of the gatekeepers on the review to merge them into master. 

*__NOTE__*: For big changes associated with feature releases/milestones, they will be merged onto the `develop` branch for more thorough QA before a final merge to `master`
