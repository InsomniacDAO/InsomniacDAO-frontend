### Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

```
./src/
├── App.jsx       // Main app page
├── abi/          // Contract ABIs from etherscan.io
├── actions/      // Redux actions 
├── assets/       // Static assets (SVGs)
├── components/   // Reusable individual components
├── constants.js/ // Mainnet Addresses & common ABI
├── contracts/    // TODO: The contracts be here as submodules
├── helpers/      // Helper methods to use in the app
├── hooks/        // Shared reactHooks
├── themes/       // Style sheets for dark vs light theme
└── views/        // Individual Views
```


## 🚀 Deployment
Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications. 

### Continuous deployment
TBD

**Pull Requests**:
Each PR into master will get its own custom URL that is visible on the PR page. QA & validate changes on that URL before merging into the deploy branch.
